    "P2": "The Interreligious Match for Peace is held for the benefit of the educational programs that Scholas develops in Africa and Latin America. For this reason, Pope Francis blessed the ball with which the next match will be played.",
    "P3": "From the beginning, Pope Francis dreamed Scholas as the possibility of giving a concrete answer to the call of this era, giving it the task of educating in openness to the other, in listening that by gathering the pieces of an atomized and meaningless world, begins to create a new culture: the Culture of Encounter.",
    "P4": "Today, more than twenty years after its first experience in Argentina, dreamed up by the then Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio - today Pope Francis - Scholas is an International Organization of Pontifical Right, with offices in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Vatican City, Spain, the United States, Haiti, Japan, Italy, Mexico, Mozambique, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal and Romania, present with its network in 190 countries, integrating more than 400 thousand educational centers and reaching more than one million children and young people around the world. Its mission is to respond to the call to create a culture of encounter, bringing young people together in an education that generates meaning.",
